# TODO

## Description

This is an opinionated task manager, based on the PARA method by Tiago Forte.

The essential principles are:

* You have several "Projects" that have a goal and deadline that you are actively working towards
* Each project is broken down into "Tasks", which help you make gradual progress towards your project goal
* Each task has a status, which helps you to prioritise what to work on next:
  * `Not started` - needs to be done at some point
  * `Next action` - when a project has several tasks, it helps to choose *just one* task that you need to work on next. Each project should always have a `next action` defined.
  * `In progress` - any tasks that you are currently actively working on
  * `Done` - woop woop! Well done, you're one step closer to completing your goals! ðŸ¥³
